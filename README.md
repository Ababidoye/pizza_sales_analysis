### Pizza Order and Sales Analysis
The Project analyzes a dataset consisting of four csv files for pizza and pizza orders. The dataset were merged using python pandas library. Thereafter further modification (addition and dropping of columns) was done on the merged dataframe to get a clean dataframe for analysis.
Questions answered in this project include: The total pizza orders made, total quantity of pizza ordered, quantity of pizza ordered and revenue generated by category, total revenue made, analysis of monthly, daily and hourly sales, ingredient usage rate and so on.
Visualization was also done using matplotlib and seaborn. The result gives reasonable story on the performance of the Pizza place, the performing pizza types and other information that can assist in overall operation of the outlet.
The project was carried out with Python programming using Jupyter Notebook.
